### Back story 
As the population increases all around the world, hospital wait times are also increasing correspondingly. We recognized this as one of the pressing issues that plague our society today. 

### How we did it
We implemented the back end using Python, while the front end was built with React. We also utilized the Microsoft Azure Text Analytics Cognitive Service API.


### Challenges we faced
The hardest challenges that we faced in this project was of the following: 
- Figuring out which programming languages to approach the front-end and back-end
- Identifying what we didn't know, and how to develop something while learning it on a short time-span
- Determining appropriate measures to take when faced with a quickly approaching deadline

### Current Features
The application can currently take in inputs from the user and return possible conditions related to the single symptom.  

### Trying it out
In order to run the application, download the repo into a folder; open cmd, run the script npm install, and then npm start to start the web app. To run the flask back end, run the script python ./json_io.py.
